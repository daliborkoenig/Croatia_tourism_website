## App Info
the course exercise was to choose a websity style on symu.co and then recreate it using HTML and CSS. 

I choose this template:
https://symu.co/freebies/templates-4/polind-psd-template/ and recreated it from scratch just by looking at the picture.

- search bars are functional and redirect to google
- all links are functional
- working visitor counter at the end
- responsive as much as i know how.
